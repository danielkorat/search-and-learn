## Extracting the MATH-500 accuracy numbers

First generate completions using `execute_experiments.sh`.

To get the final numbers for the evalations, we use a [fork](https://github.com/huggingface/Qwen2.5-Math) of the [Qwen2.5-Math evaluation repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math).
Please follow the installation and usage instructions in our fork.

Then launch the evaluation using `eval/evaluation_script_launch.sh`.
